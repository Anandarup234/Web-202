Application contains 3 pages and execution starts from index.html. 

I have used slick for carousel. 

Real time data is coming from Firebase data base and getting stored in localstorage for further manupulation.

I have written css is scss and compiling that using node-sass

Webpack is being used for bundling of the modules and resources. Code has been written in es6 and jquery.

Cart.html and checkout.html pages are using handlebars for templating. 

In home page i have used back ticks for dynamically rendering the categories and products.

1) First download the source code from git repo.

2) Then run "npm install" command to install the node modules.

3) Then run "npm run build" to generate the bundled js and css files.

4) Then run "npm run start" command to start the application.
